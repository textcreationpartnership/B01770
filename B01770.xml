            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

NevertheleÅ¿Å¿e, when we compare the Å¿acred and Å¿olemn Oaths of Allegeance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, by Statute Law, the ProteÅ¿tation and Nationall Covenant by authority of both HouÅ¿es of Parliament (obliging us to the Reformation of Religion, preÅ¿erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his MajeÅ¿ties PerÅ¿on and juÅ¿t Power, the defence of the Priviledges of Parliament and Liberties of the Subject) tendered unto, preÅ¿t upon, and all or moÅ¿t ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

by us, and Å¿o conÅ¿iderable a part of this Kingdom: Together with Å¿ome late Petitions, Declarations and RepreÅ¿entations to your Excellency and the Generall Councel of War, and your late RemonÅ¿trance to the Commons of <hi>England</hi> aÅ¿Å¿embled in Parliament, and Å¿ome proceedings thereupon, both in relation to his MajeÅ¿tie, and Å¿everall Members of Parliament: And withall, our own Station and CommiÅ¿Å¿ion from God to be Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Seers to his people, to Å¿tand upon our Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower and give warning either of approaching Å¿in or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine to the Nation: We cannot without wounding our own conÅ¿ciences, and betraying the truÅ¿t repoÅ¿ed in us, Å¿it down in Å¿ilence; but are conÅ¿trained, with all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pects to your Excellency and your Councell (and we hope, without the leaÅ¿t offence) to repreÅ¿ent and deÅ¿ire as followeth.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>FirÅ¿t, In reference to his MajeÅ¿tie.</head>
               <p>That although we are not ignorant of, nor can in the leaÅ¿t approve the profanation and abuÅ¿e of our Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Covenant by the late unlawfull Ingagement from <hi>Scotland;</hi> yet we cannot but repreÅ¿ent to you, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t to the world our utter diÅ¿Å¿ent from all proceedings againÅ¿t his MajeÅ¿ties Crown and Life: and that upon theÅ¿e enÅ¿uing grounds of ConÅ¿cience and Prudence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Å¿acred Scripture (the onely unerring rule for all undertakings) neither by precept, or precedent, or other way doth warrant or countenance Å¿uch actings of Subjects againÅ¿t their lawfull Soveraign: But this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth upon divine Record, That when the ten Tribes forÅ¿ook their King, they alÅ¿o forÅ¿ook their God, and had neither a good King, nor Å¿carce a good day afterwards. And our own Chronicles do Å¿adly tell us of a Deluge of bloud and calamities overflowing our AnceÅ¿tours upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:174836:3"/>
the DepoÅ¿ition of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, both Kings of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Law-books (as we are informed by Parliament Declarations, and as hath been lately acknowledged by your RemonÅ¿trance) Å¿uppoÅ¿e the King can do no wrong: If Å¿o, then (as wee conceive) hee cannot by any written Law forfeit his Crown and Life to his people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have Å¿olemnly bound our Å¿elves by Oaths and Covenant (from which no Authority on earth can abÅ¿olve us) not to prejudice the PerÅ¿on, nor diminiÅ¿h the juÅ¿t Authority of the King; and therefore, without manifeÅ¿t perjury (as we conceive) we cannot conÅ¿ent either to the DepoÅ¿ition of his MajeÅ¿ty, or the depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his life. And here we humbly preÅ¿ent to your moÅ¿t Å¿erious conÅ¿ideration Gods remarkable avenge upon the HouÅ¿e of <hi>Saul,</hi> of the breach of Covenant made by <hi>JoÅ¿huah</hi> with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> Å¿ome hundreds of yeers before; and that although the Scriptures tell us, hee did it out of his zeal to the HouÅ¿e of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The way of proceeding againÅ¿t his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tie will be Å¿o far from Å¿peeding a Settlement, that we beleeve, it will unvaoydably tend to the Å¿candal and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of Religion, and loÅ¿Å¿e of Liberty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the judgement of our enemies: This will be thought to verifie thoÅ¿e foul aÅ¿perÅ¿ions Å¿o often abjured by the Parliament, us, and other their friends, that the deÅ¿igne in our late juÅ¿t Defence, was the ruine of his MajeÅ¿ty, and the Å¿ubverÅ¿ion of Regal Government.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will hazard Religion, by rendring the ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors of it odious to the Common Enemy without, by Å¿haking the foundation of our Union with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by making
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:174836:4"/>
an irreparable breach amongÅ¿t men of the Å¿ame pious and honeÅ¿t intereÅ¿t at Home.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for Liberty, (Å¿o much contended for) it cannot be denied but it muÅ¿t be an invitation to forraign Princes to invade us; (their intereÅ¿t being the Å¿ame:) And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conÅ¿idering the <hi>German</hi>-Peace Å¿o lately concluded, by means whereof they cannot but be Å¿upplyed with Armies of Mercinaries that gape after Å¿uch an opportunity.</p>
               <p>But principally (we fear) this may give Life to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent deÅ¿ign now on foot in <hi>Ireland</hi> (which your and our Souls abhor) for the utter ruine of our Friends there, and Å¿peedy invading of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And finally, that this may tend to a perpetual engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the three Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in blood, all being Å¿o deeply intereÅ¿Å¿ed in the perÅ¿on of the King; and that inevitably, becauÅ¿e the Prince of Wales (the Heir apparent to the Crowns of all the three Kingdoms) is now at liberty, and may probably be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and crowned in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Å¿o not likely to want power to Å¿eat him on his Fathers Throne here in <hi>England,</hi> yea, and that poÅ¿Å¿ibly without Conditions, to the utter ruine of all that have adhered to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, whereas it is Å¿aid, That by his MajeÅ¿ties depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from his Parliament, Å¿etting up his Standard, and levying War againÅ¿t his People; they are abÅ¿olved from their allegiance to him, notwithÅ¿tanding the Oaths before mentioned: We well remember that thoÅ¿e Oaths, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Covenant, have been ConÅ¿tantly preÅ¿t upon Å¿everal Members of the Parliament, and other Subjects in this Kingdom, to the Time of the Late Treaty<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> if not Å¿ince; and that notwithÅ¿trnding the aforeÅ¿aid particulars now charged againÅ¿t his MajeÅ¿ty, and therefore muÅ¿t needs be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:174836:4"/>
either vain, (and Å¿o a High prophanation of the dreadfull name of God) or elÅ¿e obligatory. And were they not Å¿o judged, we know no convincing reaÅ¿on why they Å¿hould be now Å¿uÅ¿pended or aboliÅ¿hed. As to the execution of JuÅ¿tice upon Delinquents covenanted for, we proteÅ¿t that the Dethroning or death of his MajeÅ¿ty, in proÅ¿ecution of JuÅ¿tice, never entered into our hearts: The Å¿ame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant making Å¿peciall proviÅ¿ion for the preÅ¿ervation of his MajeÅ¿ties PerÅ¿on, Honor and Authority.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and laÅ¿tly, His MajeÅ¿ty was not taken in Battail, but having a Military power, and Å¿trong GariÅ¿ons in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> beÅ¿ides forces in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> did (being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and encouraged (as we think) by Å¿everall joint Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and ProteÅ¿tations of the Parliament of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, (promiÅ¿ing Å¿ecurity to his Royall perÅ¿on) Å¿urrender himÅ¿elf to the Army of our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by them was delivered to the CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> upon expreÅ¿s promiÅ¿e (as we are in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) that no violence Å¿hould be offered to his PerÅ¿on; and farther, when His MajeÅ¿ty went from <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> we Å¿uppoÅ¿e him at Liberty to have gone for <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but in the forementioned confidence in Parliamentary Declarations, and the reallity of the Armies intentions towards him, (for we are ignorant of other Å¿ufficient cauÅ¿e) he voluntarily betook himÅ¿elf to the IÅ¿le of Wight, then in your power.</p>

               <p>That although our Å¿oules abhorr that grand deÅ¿igne of the Devill and his Agents, to decry all religious and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous profeÅ¿Å¿ors, under the name of Sectaries and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents; and although we do willingly grant, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deÅ¿ire that the intereÅ¿t of all Godly and honeÅ¿t men may be carefully provided for, and Å¿ecured as far as is conÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the word of God, our Covenant and publique Peace, and that men of different apprehenÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in matters of leÅ¿s importance, may not therefore be rendred utterly uncapable of all Offices of power and truÅ¿t; yet conÅ¿idering of what dangerous conÅ¿equence an univerÅ¿al Toleration in matter of Religion, Å¿o much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured after in the beginning of Reformation, by the JeÅ¿uitical party, muÅ¿t needs prove to Church and State; we preÅ¿ume timouÅ¿ly to declare, That Å¿uch a Toleration is no way conÅ¿onant to the Word of God, and is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to our National Covenant.</p>
               <p>And now having herein according to our conÅ¿ciences Å¿o fully and freely diÅ¿charged our duties to God and the Kingdom, and as much as in us lyeth, freed our Å¿elves
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:174836:5"/>
from the guilt of the blood, miÅ¿ery and ruine that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us and the whole Kingdom, if not timely prevented: We moÅ¿t humbly deÅ¿ire as followeth:</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, that your Excellency will be pleaÅ¿ed (for the more Å¿peedy Å¿ettlement of the true ProteÅ¿tant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and publique peace of the Kingdom, to improve your utmoÅ¿t, That the impriÅ¿oned and Å¿ecluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that cannot juÅ¿tly be charged for betraying their TruÅ¿t, may be forthwith reÅ¿tored; and Å¿uch as Å¿hall be charged to be tryed by Parliament, according to their Priviledg.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that weighing in a juÅ¿t balance the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons before alledged, with many more that may be added in relation to his MajeÅ¿ty, we humbly deÅ¿ire your Excellency will be pleaÅ¿ed by all lawfull means to endevour the Å¿uÅ¿pending of all proceedings againÅ¿t his MajeÅ¿ties Crown and Life, untill advice had (in point of ConÅ¿cience) with the Reverend AÅ¿Å¿embly of Divines, and the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> touching the Å¿everall Oaths that lye both upon us and them, and in point of prudence, with the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who are jointly concerned with us in his MajeÅ¿ty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and laÅ¿tly, that you will endeavour a right underÅ¿tanding, a good correÅ¿pondence and mutuall confidence between King, Parliament, City, Army, and all the well-affected perÅ¿ons of the Kingdom, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o between the two Kingdoms of England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, thereby to fruÅ¿trate the great expectations of the PopipÅ¿h arty, who are high in their hopes, by reaÅ¿on of our preÅ¿ent Å¿ad diviÅ¿ions and diÅ¿tractions promiÅ¿ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:174836:6"/>
to themÅ¿elves (and doe not Å¿tick to declare it) a greater advantage to them and their Religion now, then if the King had prevailed by an abÅ¿olute ConqueÅ¿t. As alÅ¿o to haÅ¿ten relief to our poor Brethren in bleeding and gaÅ¿ping Ireland, for whom England hath kept the Å¿olemn monethly FaÅ¿t, near Å¿even years together.</p>
               <p>But (to draw towards a concluÅ¿ion) we do here Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly profeÅ¿Å¿, That it is not the leaÅ¿t receding from our firÅ¿t Å¿ound principles upon which either with our perÅ¿ons, prayers, purÅ¿es, or al we engaged with the Parliament in the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd war; nor our own intereÅ¿t in Church patrimony or power, (God will provide) or indeed any other byaÅ¿s of Å¿elf-ends, or reÅ¿pects whatÅ¿oever, did move us thus to declare our Å¿elves, but the meer ConÅ¿cience of the many Oaths of God, in which the Parliament, You, We, and the generality of the wel-affected in the Kingdom indiÅ¿penÅ¿ably Å¿tand bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, Angels and Men, That we deÅ¿ire to waÅ¿h our hands, as from the blood of all men, Å¿o eÅ¿pecially of our dread Soveraign; and to approve our Å¿elves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of all that blood and miÅ¿ery the depoÅ¿ing and taking away his MajeÅ¿ties life, will (in our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion) involve us, our poÅ¿terity, and all men profeÅ¿Å¿ing godlineÅ¿s in the three Kingdoms in. We doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from our Å¿oul beÅ¿eech and importune you, and every one of you, as Men, Gentlemen, and ChriÅ¿tian Souldiers, by all that is or can be dear to good men, as you deÅ¿ire to render a good account of your actions at the great Day to the righteous Judg of heaven &amp; earth, That you will forbear doing ought in the premiÅ¿es, which may wound the conÅ¿cience, or peirce the hearts of any of Gods people (who are all alike with you, or

any of you, precious to him as the apple of his eye) which may rend and tear the bowels of this your and our native Country, and occaÅ¿ion the common Enemy to blaÅ¿pheme the MajeÅ¿ty, Truth and CauÅ¿e of our God and your God: And further to contribute the utmoÅ¿t skil, Å¿tudy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of you and every of you in your proper places, (and the great CounÅ¿ellour and mighty God direct you all) to remove ours and the Kingdoms fears, to remedie the preÅ¿ent abounding diÅ¿tempers, and preÅ¿ent and univerÅ¿all deÅ¿truction; That we and the generations to come may riÅ¿e up and call you bleÅ¿Å¿ed, and Å¿o eminent a PreÅ¿ervation of the Kingdom in Å¿uch an extremity, may be had in everlaÅ¿ting remembrance.</p>

            <p>THe great breaches which now for Å¿ome time have, and Å¿till are made upon thoÅ¿e publick Endearments to us, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Religion, our King and Parliament, do Å¿orely preÅ¿Å¿e us, and wound us deeply; What Å¿hall we do? We cannot keep Å¿ilence, we dare not; if we Å¿hould, our ConÅ¿ciences would not. Great are our fears, but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are our duties, for the performance of which, we have trampled down all our fears, and through Gods mercy have met together, and reÅ¿olved with one heart and voice to own the Vows of God upon us, and according to their obligation (if we can do no more, yet) at leaÅ¿t to deliver our own Å¿ouls. In order whereunto, we, and Å¿ome others of our Brethren have choÅ¿en and Å¿ent up our Brethren, Mr. <hi>Samuel Welles</hi> MiniÅ¿ter of <hi>Banbury,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Bayly</hi> MiniÅ¿ter of <hi>Frenckford,</hi> to wait upon you at <hi>London:</hi> whoÅ¿e Labours in this very thing alÅ¿o, according to the wiÅ¿dom and zeal given you, we hear of, and rejoyce in, praying for you, that they may not be in vain in the Lord: They will acquaint you with our <hi>Humble Advice to the Lord Generall and his General Councel;</hi> which (though of it Å¿elf it be a poor nail hammered by us inferiour Workmen) yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faÅ¿tened by the hands of Å¿uch MaÅ¿ters of the AÅ¿Å¿emblies as your Å¿elves) may enter the deeper, and Å¿tick the faÅ¿ter. We beÅ¿eech you to peruÅ¿e it, and to direct them in all things conducing to the right mannaging of it; and to admit our few mites into the TreaÅ¿ury of your Religion and Loyalty. And the God and Father of lights di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and aÅ¿siÅ¿t you and us to Å¿hine as lights in the midÅ¿t of a froward generation. To his Mercies we commend you, and reÅ¿t</p>
